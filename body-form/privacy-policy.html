    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted">Effective date: October 17, 2025</p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how BodyForm ("we", "us", or "our"), developed and published by an individual developer, respects your privacy. BodyForm is designed to run entirely on your device. We do <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or transmit any personal data to our own servers.</p>

    <h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>BodyForm does not collect, transmit, or store any personal information outside of your device. Measurement entries, preferences, and any other information you add remain on the device or within your personal iCloud account if you enable Apple-provided syncing. We do not operate external databases or analytics services.</p>

    <h2>Health and Fitness Data</h2>
    <p>Your measurements and progress information are sensitive health data. BodyForm keeps this data local to your device and, where available, secured by Apple-provided mechanisms such as device passcodes, Face ID, or Touch ID. We do not have access to this information.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>BodyForm does not integrate with advertising networks or third-party analytics services. Any platform features you choose to enable (for example, Apple iCloud syncing or system backups) are governed by Apple&apos;s respective terms and privacy notices.</p>

    <h2>Children&apos;s Privacy</h2>
    <p>BodyForm is not directed to children under the age of 13. Because we do not collect personal information, we do not knowingly solicit or store information from children.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We rely on the security features provided by Apple and your device. Please use a secure passcode and keep your operating system up to date to protect your information.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect app changes or legal requirements. When we do, we will update the effective date above. Continued use of BodyForm after a change means you accept the updated policy.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:monkeycodeapp@gmail.com">monkeycodeapp@gmail.com</a>.</p>
